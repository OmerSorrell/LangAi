## Japanese Language Module

### Writing Systems

Japanese uses three writing systems. Introduce them based on level:

1. **Hiragana (ひらがな)** - 46 characters
   - Used for native Japanese words, particles, verb endings
   - Introduce at A1, mastery expected by A2
   - Example: たべる (taberu - to eat)

2. **Katakana (カタカナ)** - 46 characters
   - Used for foreign words, onomatopoeia, emphasis
   - Introduce at A1, mastery expected by A2
   - Example: コーヒー (koohii - coffee)

3. **Kanji (漢字)** - ~2,000 common characters
   - Chinese characters with Japanese readings
   - Progressive introduction following JLPT levels:
     - N5: ~100 kanji (A1-A2)
     - N4: ~300 kanji (A2-B1)
     - N3: ~600 kanji (B1)
     - N2: ~1,000 kanji (B2)
     - N1: ~2,000 kanji (C1-C2)

### Politeness Levels (敬語 - Keigo)

This is CRITICAL for cultural fluency. Japanese has distinct speech levels:

1. **丁寧語 (Teineigo) - Polite Form**
   - Standard polite speech using です/ます
   - Safe default for most situations
   - Example: 食べます (tabemasu - I eat)

2. **普通形 (Futsūkei) - Plain/Casual Form**
   - Used with friends, family, in informal settings
   - Example: 食べる (taberu - I eat)
   - NEVER use with strangers, elders, or superiors initially

3. **尊敬語 (Sonkeigo) - Honorific Speech**
   - Elevates the other person's actions
   - Used for customers, superiors, respected figures
   - Example: 召し上がる (meshiagaru - to eat [honorific])

4. **謙譲語 (Kenjōgo) - Humble Speech**
   - Lowers your own actions
   - Shows respect by being humble
   - Example: いただく (itadaku - to receive [humble])

**Cultural Rule**: When in doubt, use polite form. It's better to be too polite than too casual.

### Key Grammar Points by Level

- Basic sentence structure: Subject は Object を Verb
- Particles: は, が, を, に, で, と, も, の

**A2 (JLPT N4)**
- て-form connections

- Conditional: ～たら, ～ば

**C1-C2 (JLPT N1)**

### Cultural Context Points

Always weave these into lessons when relevant:

1. **Uchi/Soto (内/外) - In-group/Out-group**
   - Language changes based on relationships
   - How you speak to family vs strangers vs coworkers

2. **Honne/Tatemae (本音/建前) - True feelings/Public facade**
   - Japanese often speak indirectly
   - "ちょっと..." often means "no"
   - Teach reading between the lines

3. **Seasonal Awareness (季節感)**
   - Japanese culture is deeply tied to seasons
   - Greetings change by season
   - Food, fashion, activities are season-specific

4. **Gift-Giving (お土産, お中元, お歳暮)**
   - Complex rules about giving/receiving
   - Always refuse once before accepting
   - "つまらないものですが" (It's a trivial thing, but...)

5. **Business Culture**
   - 名刺交換 (meishi kōkan) - business card exchange
   - Email etiquette
   - Meeting protocols

### Common Mistakes by English Speakers

Watch for and gently correct:
- Using pronouns too much (Japanese drops them)
- Word order errors (SOV vs SVO)
- Particle confusion (は vs が)
- Politeness level mixing
- Direct translation of English idioms

### Pronunciation Tips

- Japanese is mora-timed, not stress-timed
- Long vowels matter: おばさん (aunt) vs おばあさん (grandmother)
- Pitch accent exists but varies by region
- R sound is between English L and R
