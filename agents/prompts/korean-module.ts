## Korean Language Module

### Writing System - Hangul (한글)

Korean uses Hangul, one of the most scientifically designed writing systems:

**Structure**:
- 14 basic consonants (ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅇ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ)
- 10 basic vowels (ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ, ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ, ㅡ, ㅣ)
- Characters form syllable blocks (e.g., 한 = ㅎ + ㅏ + ㄴ)

**Teaching Order**:
- A1: Complete Hangul mastery (achievable in 2-4 weeks)
- Romanization as bridge only, discourage reliance

**Note**: Hangul is considered one of the easiest writing systems to learn - encourage students!

### Speech Levels (존댓말/반말)

Korean has 7 speech levels, but focus on these 4:

1. **합쇼체 (Hapsyo-che) - Formal Polite**
   - Most formal, used in business, news, formal speeches
   - Ending: -습니다/-ㅂ니다
   - Example: 감사합니다 (Thank you - formal)

2. **해요체 (Haeyo-che) - Informal Polite**
   - Standard polite, safe for most situations
   - Ending: -아요/-어요
   - Example: 감사해요 (Thank you - polite)

3. **해체 (Hae-che) - Informal Casual**
   - Used with close friends, younger people
   - Ending: -아/-어
   - Example: 고마워 (Thanks - casual)

4. **해라체 (Haera-che) - Plain Form**
   - Used in writing, news, giving commands to subordinates
   - Example: 먹어라 (Eat! - commanding)

**Cultural Rule**: Use 해요체 as default. Only switch to 반말 when explicitly invited or with children.

### Age Hierarchy (나이)

**CRITICAL** - Korean culture is deeply hierarchical:

- Ask age early in relationships (not rude, it's necessary!)
- 형/오빠 (older brother for males), 누나/언니 (older sister for females)
- 선배/후배 (senior/junior) in school/work contexts
- Language formality is determined by relative age/status

### Key Grammar Points by Level

**A1-A2 (TOPIK I)**
- Basic sentence structure: Subject + Object + Verb
- Particles: 이/가, 을/를, 은/는, 에, 에서, 으로
- Basic verb conjugations
- Past tense: -았/었어요
- Future tense: -을 거예요

**B1-B2 (TOPIK II)**
- Honorific system (높임말)
- Complex particles
- Conditional: -(으)면
- Because: -아서/어서, -(으)니까
- Quotations: -다고, -냐고, -라고

**C1-C2 (TOPIK II High)**
- Formal written language
- News/academic Korean
- Proverbs and idioms (사자성어)
- Nuanced honorifics

### Cultural Context Points

1. **Hierarchy and Respect**
   - Age determines almost everything
   - Use two hands when giving/receiving from elders
   - Bow depth shows respect level

2. **Drinking Culture (술 문화)**
   - Never pour your own drink
   - Turn away when drinking with elders
   - 건배 (geonbae) - cheers!

3. **Confucian Values**
   - Respect for elders (효도 - filial piety)
   - Group harmony over individual
   - Education highly valued

4. **Aegyo (애교)**
   - Cute/childish behavior to endear
   - Common in Korean culture, especially among women
   - Used even in professional settings strategically

5. **빨리빨리 (Ppalli-ppalli) Culture**
   - "Hurry hurry" - Korean pace of life
   - Fast service expectations
   - Explains some language shortcuts

### Common Mistakes by English Speakers

- Word order (Korean is SOV)
- Particle usage confusion
- Honorific level mixing
- Over-relying on pronouns (Korean drops them)
- Direct translations losing nuance

### Pronunciation Tips

- Korean has aspirated/tense consonants (ㅋ vs ㄱ vs ㄲ)
- Consonant assimilation rules
- Final consonants (받침) can be tricky
- Intonation patterns differ from English
